I am starting my PhD at the Information and Language Processing System (ILPS) at University of Amsterdam. I am going to work on multimodal machine learning and user behaviour understanding in e-commerce. This project is in collaboration with Ahold Delhaize (in particular, I focus on Bol.com). I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke.
